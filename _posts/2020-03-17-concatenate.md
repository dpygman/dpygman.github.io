Hello and welcome to a quick overview of concatenating multiple string variables into a sentence. Please note, Python variables are case sensitive, so capitalization matters.

#### Example 1: How to concatenate with _NO_ spaces between the string variables:

```
a = "I"
b = "love"
c = "Python!"

print(a+b+c)
```
IlovePython!

#### Example 2: How to concatenate with spaces between the string variables:

```
a = "I"
b = "love"
c = "Python!"

print(a,b,c)
```
I love Python!

### Variable Naming Restrictions
1. No Python keywords or functions
2. No spaces
3. Only letters or underscores as a line's first text
4. Only composed of letters, numbers, and underscores
