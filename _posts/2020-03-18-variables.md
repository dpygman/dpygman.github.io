Hello and welcome to a brief overview of some important aspects of Python variables. 

## What are variables? Variables are names given to certain program values.

Think of variables as data containers. Justlike when a persomn stores something in a box for later use, computers do the same thing via variables. When a user asks a computer to perform an operation, the program executing the operation often requires sets of values, stored in the program's memory and refer to in Python as variables, to referrence while performing the requested operation.

For example:
```
>>>length = 6
>>>width = 2
>>>area = length * width
>>>print(area)
```
12

### Variable Data Types = Any (e.g., numbers, strings, outputs, etc.)

### What is assignment? Assignment is the process of storing a value in a variable.
In the example above, we assigned the value 6 to the length variable and the value 2 to the width variable.

Think: __Variable = Value__

### What is an expression? An expression is a combination of variable (e.g., numbers, words, symbols, etc.) that the computer program processes to produce an output or result.
In the example above, the expression is 12. We arrived at 12 by multiplying the values 6 and 2 (i.e., length * width).

In programming, variables are important, because variables let you perform operations on data that may change.

Usually, you can name variables whatever you want, just avoid the following:

### Variable Naming Restrictions
1. No Python keywords or functions
2. No spaces
3. Only letters or underscores as a line's first text
4. Only composed of letters, numbers, and underscores
