Hello and welcome to a brief overview of some important aspects of Python variables. 

## What are variables? Variables are names given to certain program values.

Think of variables as data containers. Justlike when a persomn stores something in a box for later use, computers do the same thing via variables. When a user asks a computer to perform an operation, the program executing the operation often requires sets of values, stored in the program's memory and refer to in Python as variables, to referrence while performing the requested operation.

For example:
```
>>>length = 6
>>>width = 2
>>>area = length * width
>>>print(area)
```
12

### Variable Naming Restrictions
1. No Python keywords or functions
2. No spaces
3. Only letters or underscores as a line's first text
4. Only composed of letters, numbers, and underscores

### Variable Data Types = Any (e.g., numbers, strings, outputs, etc.)
