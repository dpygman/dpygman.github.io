Hello and welcome to my Portfolio website build. Please find some simple code examples below to get started.

### Python Code Block:
```python
    import numpy as np
    
    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

### Fun with Python Code
```
`print("Roses are red")`
`print("Violets are blue")`
`print("I love you")`
```
```
`color = input("Enter a color or something fun: ")`
`plural_noun = input("Enter a plural noun or something fun: ")`
`celebrity = input("Enter a celebrity's name or something fun: ")`
```

Enter a color or something fun: `wrong`  
Enter a plural noun or something fun: `Pilots`  
Enter a celebrity or something fun: `to watch The Bachelor with my wife too` 

Roses are wrong     
Pilots are blue  
I love to watch The Bachelor with my wife too  


### R Code Block
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

### Inline Code
`x+y`
