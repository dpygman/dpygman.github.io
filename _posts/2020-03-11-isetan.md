## 1. Introduction
Perfect for Paris and arguably the trendiest department store in Japan, the flagship Isetan Shinjuku is renowned for having its window displays created by leading artists and offers only the finest in food, clothing and homeware. Working from the bottom up, you'll find the 'beauty apothecary' on the second basement floor, food and travel items on the other basement level, and the other seven floors dedicated to ladies' fashion and homeware. The project seeks to fuse the best of Japanese and Parisian shopping. Paris' fashionistas demand the best of the Fat East and bringing Isetan to Paris delivers.
