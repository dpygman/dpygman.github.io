Hello,  
I possess experience as a data scientist and business intelligence leader for a Fortune 5 organization, with significant additional experience in healthcare technology (e.g., electronic medical records, care management systems, member applications, claims systems, etc.) and coding skills. While I focus on Python proficiency, I possess additional experience working with R, Java, Javascript, HTML, and numerous additional languages and technology. 

During my career, I achieved a high-degree of technical proficiency, do to my natural interest in technology, which I am currently in the process of formalizing through continuing education. I am a US citizen, who loves to work with technology, while continuously learning and growing. Thank you for taking the time to view my website and please let me know if I might be of assistance.  

Best regards,  

David
