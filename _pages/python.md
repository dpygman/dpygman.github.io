## Introduction to Python

The Python programming language's name references back to the BBC's comedy show "Monty Python's Flying Circus."

__What is a computer program?__

A computer program is a list of instructions that tells a computer what to do step-by-step to produce a desired outcome.

__So what is a programming language?__

Programmers write computer program instructions in a __programming language__, the same way a person might write instruction in english, so an English speaker can read and follow them. Just like there are multiple human languages (e.g., English, Spanish, French, etc.), there are many programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++, etc.).

#### Subjects and Predicates
Just like the English language, Python code contains subjects and predicates.

__Subject__ = Person, Place, or Thing  
__Predicate__ = What the Subject is doing. An action or verb.

```
Example:

John loves to program in Python.

Subject = John  
Predicate = program
```

#### Syntax and Semantics

__Syntax__ = Instruction Writting Rules  
__Semantics__ = Instruction's Effect

#### Python as a Programming Language
Python is a relatively simple and flexible programming language that allows the programmer to build interchangable modules of code that can be lifted out of one program and easily placed into another.
