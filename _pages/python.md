## Introduction to Python

The Python programming language's name references back to the BBC's comedy show "Monty Python's Flying Circus."

__So what is a programming language?__ A computer program is a list of instructions that tells a computer what to do step-by-step to produce a desired outcome. Programmers write the instruction in a __programming language__, the same way a person might write instruction in english, so an English speaker can read and follow them. Just like there are multiple human languages (e.g., English, Spanish, French, etc.), there are many programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++, etc.).

Python is a relatively simple and flexible programming language that allows the programmer to build interchangable modules of code that can be lifted out of one program and easily placed into another.
